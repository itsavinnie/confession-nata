        <h1 class="animated-text">Hi Nata!!❤💕</h1>
        <p class="animated-text">I’ve been thinking a lot about us lately, and I just want to be honest. I really like you,  I know a long-distance relationship can be tough, and I don’t want to rush into anything you’re not comfortable with. I’m also a bit scared because I want to be able to make you happy. But I’m also willing to take that leap if you are. You’re someone I don’t want to let slip away, no matter the distance. I know I have my flaws, but I’ll do my best for you and would love for you to help me become the man you want. So, what do you think? Do you want to go on this journey with me? 😤🤯</p>
